Now that you have all your arguments parsed and initialized, here's what you typically need to do next for the philosophers problem:

## 1. **Design your main data structures**


- Create a structure for individual philosophers (containing philosopher ID, last meal time, meal count, etc.)
- Create a structure for forks/mutexes
- Create a main program structure that holds all shared data



## 2. **Initialize mutexes**


- Create mutexes for each fork (one per philosopher)
- Create a mutex for printing (to avoid mixed output)
- Possibly create a mutex for shared variables like death flag



## 3. **Create philosopher threads**


- Allocate memory for an array of philosopher structures
- Initialize each philosopher with their ID, assigned forks, and shared data
- Create a thread for each philosopher



## 4. **Implement the philosopher routine**



- The main loop each philosopher will execute (eat, sleep, think)
- Handle fork picking and dropping logic
- Implement timing for each action



## 5. **Implement monitoring**


- Create a monitoring thread or mechanism to check if any philosopher has died
- Check if all philosophers have eaten the required number of meals (if specified)



## 6. **Cleanup**


- Join all threads
- Destroy mutexes
- Free allocated memory


The next logical step would be to design and implement your main data structures for philosophers and forks, then move on to mutex initialization.
